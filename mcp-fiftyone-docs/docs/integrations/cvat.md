# CVAT Integration#

[CVAT](https://github.com/opencv/cvat) is one of the most popular open-source image and video annotation tools available, and weâve made it easy to upload your data directly from FiftyOne to CVAT to add or edit labels.

You can use CVAT either through the hosted server at [app.cvat.ai](https://app.cvat.ai) or through a [self-hosted server](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/installation/). In either case, FiftyOne provides simple setup instructions that you can use to specify the necessary account credentials and server endpoint to use.

Note

Did you know? You can request, manage, and import annotations from within the FiftyOne App by installing the [@voxel51/annotation](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins/tree/main/plugins/annotation) plugin!

CVAT provides three levels of abstraction for annotation workflows: projects, tasks, and jobs. A job contains one or more images and can be assigned to a specific annotator or reviewer. A task defines the label schema to use for annotation and contains one or more jobs. A project can optionally be created to group multiple tasks together under a shared label schema.

FiftyOne provides an API to create tasks and jobs, upload data, define label schemas, and download annotations using CVAT, all programmatically in Python. All of the following label types are supported, for both image and video datasets:

  * [Classifications](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#classification)

  * [Detections](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#object-detection)

  * [Instance segmentations](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#instance-segmentation)

  * [Polygons and polylines](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#polylines)

  * [Keypoints](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#keypoints)

  * [Scalar fields](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#adding-sample-fields)

  * [Semantic segmentation](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#semantic-segmentation)




Note

Check out [this tutorial](../tutorials/cvat_annotation.html) to see how you can use FiftyOne to upload your data to CVAT to create, delete, and fix annotations.

## Basic recipe#

The basic workflow to use CVAT to add or edit labels on your FiftyOne datasets is as follows:

  1. [Load a dataset](../user_guide/import_datasets.html#importing-datasets) into FiftyOne

  2. Explore the dataset using the [App](../user_guide/app.html#fiftyone-app) or [dataset views](../user_guide/using_views.html#using-views) to locate either unlabeled samples that you wish to annotate or labeled samples whose annotations you want to edit

  3. Use the [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") method on your dataset or view to upload the samples and optionally their existing labels to CVAT

  4. In CVAT, perform the necessary annotation work

  5. Back in FiftyOne, load your dataset and use the [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") method to merge the annotations back into your FiftyOne dataset

  6. If desired, delete the CVAT tasks and the record of the annotation run from your FiftyOne dataset




  
The example below demonstrates this workflow.

Note

You must create an account at [app.cvat.ai](https://app.cvat.ai) in order to run this example.

Note that you can store your credentials as described in this section to avoid entering them manually each time you interact with CVAT.

First, we create the annotation tasks in CVAT:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3from fiftyone import ViewField as F
     4
     5# Step 1: Load your data into FiftyOne
     6
     7dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
     8    "quickstart", dataset_name="cvat-annotation-example"
     9)
    10dataset.persistent = True
    11
    12dataset.evaluate_detections(
    13    "predictions", gt_field="ground_truth", eval_key="eval"
    14)
    15
    16# Step 2: Locate a subset of your data requiring annotation
    17
    18# Create a view that contains only high confidence false positive model
    19# predictions, with samples containing the most false positives first
    20most_fp_view = (
    21    dataset
    22    .filter_labels("predictions", (F("confidence") > 0.8) & (F("eval") == "fp"))
    23    .sort_by(F("predictions.detections").length(), reverse=True)
    24)
    25
    26# Let's edit the ground truth annotations for the sample with the most
    27# high confidence false positives
    28sample_id = most_fp_view.first().id
    29view = dataset.select(sample_id)
    30
    31# Step 3: Send samples to CVAT
    32
    33# A unique identifier for this run
    34anno_key = "cvat_basic_recipe"
    35
    36view.annotate(
    37    anno_key,
    38    label_field="ground_truth",
    39    attributes=["iscrowd"],
    40    launch_editor=True,
    41)
    42print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    43
    44# Step 4: Perform annotation in CVAT and save the tasks
    

Then, once the annotation work is complete, we merge the annotations back into FiftyOne:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2
     3anno_key = "cvat_basic_recipe"
     4
     5# Step 5: Merge annotations back into FiftyOne dataset
     6
     7dataset = fo.load_dataset("cvat-annotation-example")
     8dataset.load_annotations(anno_key)
     9
    10# Load the view that was annotated in the App
    11view = dataset.load_annotation_view(anno_key)
    12session = fo.launch_app(view=view)
    13
    14# Step 6: Cleanup
    15
    16# Delete tasks from CVAT
    17results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    18results.cleanup()
    19
    20# Delete run record (not the labels) from FiftyOne
    21dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Note

Skip to this section to see a variety of common CVAT annotation patterns.

## Setup#

FiftyOne supports both [app.cvat.ai](https://app.cvat.ai) and [self-hosted servers](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/installation/).

The easiest way to get started is to use the default server [app.cvat.ai](https://app.cvat.ai), which simply requires creating an account and then providing your authentication credentials as shown below.

Note

CVAT is the default annotation backend used by FiftyOne. However, if you have changed your default backend, you can opt-in to using CVAT on a one-off basis by passing the optional `backend` parameter to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"):
    
    
    view.annotate(anno_key, backend="cvat", ...)
    

Refer to [these instructions](annotation.html#annotation-setup) to see how to permanently change your default backend.

### Authentication#

In order to connect to a CVAT server, you must provide your login credentials, which can be done in a variety of ways.

**Environment variables (recommended)**

The recommended way to configure your CVAT login credentials is to store them in the `FIFTYONE_CVAT_USERNAME` and `FIFTYONE_CVAT_PASSWORD` environment variables. These are automatically accessed by FiftyOne whenever a connection to CVAT is made.
    
    
    export FIFTYONE_CVAT_USERNAME=...
    export FIFTYONE_CVAT_PASSWORD=...
    export FIFTYONE_CVAT_EMAIL=...  # if applicable
    

**FiftyOne annotation config**

You can also store your credentials in your [annotation config](annotation.html#annotation-config) located at `~/.fiftyone/annotation_config.json`:
    
    
    {
        "backends": {
            "cvat": {
                ...
                "username": ...,
                "password": ...,
                "email": ...  # if applicable
            }
        }
    }
    

Note that this file will not exist until you create it.

Warning

Storing your username and password in plain text on disk is generally not recommended. Consider using environment variables instead.

**Keyword arguments**

You can manually provide your login credentials as keyword arguments each time you call methods like [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") and [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") that require connections to CVAT:
    
    
    1view.annotate(anno_key, ..., username=..., password=...)
    

**Command line prompt**

If you have not stored your login credentials via another method, you will be prompted to enter them interactively in your shell each time you call a method that requires a connection to CVAT:
    
    
    1view.annotate(anno_key, label_field="ground_truth", launch_editor=True)
    
    
    
    Please enter your login credentials.
    You can avoid this in the future by setting your `FIFTYONE_CVAT_USERNAME` and `FIFTYONE_CVAT_PASSWORD` environment variables.
    Username: ...
    Password: ...
    

### Self-hosted servers#

If you wish to use a [self-hosted server](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/installation/), you can configure the URL of your server in any of the following ways:

  * Set the `FIFTYONE_CVAT_URL` environment variable:



    
    
    export FIFTYONE_CVAT_URL=http://localhost:8080
    

  * Store the `url` of your server in your [annotation config](annotation.html#annotation-config) at `~/.fiftyone/annotation_config.json`:



    
    
    {
        "backends": {
            "cvat": {
                "url": "http://localhost:8080",
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    

  * Pass the `url` parameter manually each time you call [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"):



    
    
    1view.annotate(anno_key, ..., url="http://localhost:8080")
    

If your self-hosted server requires additional headers in order to make HTTP requests, you can provide them in either of the following ways:

  * Store your custom headers in a `headers` key of your [annotation config](annotation.html#annotation-config) at `~/.fiftyone/annotation_config.json`:



    
    
    {
        "backends": {
            "cvat": {
                ...
                "headers": {
                    "<name>": "<value>",
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

  * Pass the `headers` parameter manually each time you call [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") and [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations"):



    
    
    1view.annotate(anno_key, ... headers=...)
    2view.load_annotations(anno_key, ... headers=...)
    

## Requesting annotations#

Use the [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") method to send the samples and optionally existing labels in a [`Dataset`](../api/fiftyone.core.dataset.html#fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset "fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset") or [`DatasetView`](../api/fiftyone.core.view.html#fiftyone.core.view.DatasetView "fiftyone.core.view.DatasetView") to CVAT for annotation.

The basic syntax is:
    
    
    1anno_key = "..."
    2view.annotate(anno_key, ...)
    

The `anno_key` argument defines a unique identifier for the annotation run, and you will provide it to methods like [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations"), [`get_annotation_info()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations"), [`load_annotation_results()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotation_results "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotation_results"), [`rename_annotation_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_annotation_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_annotation_run"), and [`delete_annotation_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run") to manage the run in the future.

Warning

FiftyOne assumes that all labels in an annotation run can fit in memory.

If you are annotating very large scale video datasets with dense frame labels, you may violate this assumption. Instead, consider breaking the work into multiple smaller annotation runs that each contain limited subsets of the samples you wish to annotate.

You can use [`Dataset.stats()`](../api/fiftyone.core.dataset.html#fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.stats "fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.stats") to get a sense for the total size of the labels in a dataset as a rule of thumb to estimate the size of a candidate annotation run.

In addition, [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") provides various parameters that you can use to customize the annotation tasks that you wish to be performed.

The following parameters are supported by all annotation backends:

  * **backend** (_None_): the annotation backend to use. Use `"cvat"` for the CVAT backend. The supported values are `fiftyone.annotation_config.backends.keys()` and the default is `fiftyone.annotation_config.default_backend`

  * **media_field** (_âfilepathâ_): the sample field containing the path to the source media to upload

  * **launch_editor** (_False_): whether to launch the annotation backendâs editor after uploading the samples




The following parameters allow you to configure the labeling schema to use for your annotation tasks. See this section for more details:

  * **label_schema** (_None_): a dictionary defining the label schema to use. If this argument is provided, it takes precedence over `label_field` and `label_type`

  * **label_field** (_None_): a string indicating a new or existing label field to annotate

    * `"polylines"`: polylines stored in [`Polylines`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Polylines "fiftyone.core.labels.Polylines") fields with their [`filled`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled "fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled") attributes set to `False`

    * `"polygons"`: polygons stored in [`Polylines`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Polylines "fiftyone.core.labels.Polylines") fields with their [`filled`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled "fiftyone.core.labels.Polyline.filled") attributes set to `True`

    * `"keypoints"`: keypoints stored in [`Keypoints`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Keypoints "fiftyone.core.labels.Keypoints") fields

    * `"segmentation"`: semantic segmentations stored in [`Segmentation`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Segmentation "fiftyone.core.labels.Segmentation") fields

    * `"scalar"`: scalar labels stored in [`IntField`](../api/fiftyone.core.fields.html#fiftyone.core.fields.IntField "fiftyone.core.fields.IntField"), [`FloatField`](../api/fiftyone.core.fields.html#fiftyone.core.fields.FloatField "fiftyone.core.fields.FloatField"), [`StringField`](../api/fiftyone.core.fields.html#fiftyone.core.fields.StringField "fiftyone.core.fields.StringField"), or [`BooleanField`](../api/fiftyone.core.fields.html#fiftyone.core.fields.BooleanField "fiftyone.core.fields.BooleanField") fields

All new label fields must have their type specified via this argument or in `label_schema`

  * **classes** (_None_): a list of strings indicating the class options for `label_field` or all fields in `label_schema` without classes specified. All new label fields must have a class list provided via one of the supported methods. For existing label fields, if classes are not provided by this argument nor `label_schema`, the observed labels on your dataset are used

  * **attributes** (_True_): specifies the label attributes of each label field to include (other than their `label`, which is always included) in the annotation export. Can be any of the following:

    * `True`: export all label attributes

    * `False`: donât export any custom label attributes

    * a list of label attributes to export

    * a dict mapping attribute names to dicts specifying the `type`, `values`, and `default` for each attribute

If a `label_schema` is also provided, this parameter determines which attributes are included for all fields that do not explicitly define their per-field attributes (in addition to any per-class attributes)

  * **mask_targets** (_None_): a dict mapping pixel values (2D masks) or RGB hex strings (3D masks) to semantic label strings. Only applicable when annotating semantic segmentations. All new label fields must have mask targets provided via one of the supported methods. For existing label fields, if mask targets are not provided by this argument nor `label_schema`, any applicable mask targets stored on your dataset will be used, if available

  * **allow_additions** (_True_): whether to allow new labels to be added. Only applicable when editing existing label fields

  * **allow_deletions** (_True_): whether to allow labels to be deleted. Only applicable when editing existing label fields

  * **allow_label_edits** (_True_): whether to allow the `label` attribute of existing labels to be modified. Only applicable when editing existing fields with `label` attributes

  * **allow_index_edits** (_True_): whether to allow the `index` attribute of existing video tracks to be modified. Only applicable when editing existing frame fields with `index` attributes

  * **allow_spatial_edits** (_True_): whether to allow edits to the spatial properties (bounding boxes, vertices, keypoints, masks, etc) of labels. Only applicable when editing existing spatial label fields




  
In addition, the following CVAT-specific parameters from [`CVATBackendConfig`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATBackendConfig "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATBackendConfig") can also be provided:

  * **task_size** (_None_): an optional maximum number of images to upload per task. Videos are always uploaded one per task

  * **segment_size** (_None_): the maximum number of images to upload per job. Not applicable to videos

  * **image_quality** (_75_): an int in `[0, 100]` determining the image quality to upload to CVAT

  * **use_cache** (_True_): whether to use a cache when uploading data. Using a cache reduces task creation time as data will be processed on-the-fly and stored in the cache when requested

  * **use_zip_chunks** (_True_): when annotating videos, whether to upload video frames in smaller chunks. Setting this option to `False` may result in reduced video quality in CVAT due to size limitations on ZIP files that can be uploaded to CVAT

  * **chunk_size** (_None_): the number of frames to upload per ZIP chunk

  * **task_assignee** (_None_): the username to assign the generated tasks. This argument can be a list of usernames when annotating videos as each video is uploaded to a separate task

  * **job_assignees** (_None_): a list of usernames to assign jobs

  * **job_reviewers** (_None_): a list of usernames to assign job reviews. Only available in CVAT v1 servers

  * **project_name** (_None_): an optional project name to which to upload the created CVAT task. If a project with this name exists, it will be used, otherwise a new project is created. By default, no project is used

  * **project_id** (_None_): an optional ID of an existing CVAT project to which to upload the annotation tasks. By default, no project is used

  * **task_name** (None): an optional task name to use for the created CVAT task

  * **group_id_attr** (_None_): an optional attribute name containing existing group ids and/or in which to store downloaded group ids for all objects in the annotation run

  * **issue_tracker** (_None_): URL(s) of an issue tracker to link to the created task(s). This argument can be a list of URLs when annotating videos or when using `task_size` and generating multiple tasks

  * **organization** (_None_): the name of the organization to use when sending requests to CVAT

  * **frame_start** (_None_): nonnegative integer(s) defining the first frame of videos to upload when creating video tasks. Supported values are:

    * `integer`: the first frame to upload for each video

    * `list`: a list of first frame integers corresponding to videos in the given samples

    * `dict`: a dictionary mapping sample filepaths to first frame integers to use for the corresponding videos

  * **frame_stop** (_None_): nonnegative integer(s) defining the last frame of videos to upload when creating video tasks. Supported values are:

    * `integer`: the last frame to upload for each video

    * `list`: a list of last frame integers corresponding to videos in the given samples

    * `dict`: a dictionary mapping sample filepaths to last frame integers to use for the corresponding videos

  * **frame_step** (_None_): positive integer(s) defining which frames to sample when creating video tasks. Supported values are:

    * `integer`: the frame step to apply to each video task

    * `list`: a list of frame step integers corresponding to videos in the given samples

    * `dict`: a dictionary mapping sample filepaths to frame step integers to use for the corresponding videos

Note that this argument cannot be provided when uploading existing tracks




### Label schema#

The `label_schema`, `label_field`, `label_type`, `classes`, `attributes`, and `mask_targets` parameters to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") allow you to define the annotation schema that you wish to be used.

The label schema may define new label field(s) that you wish to populate, and it may also include existing label field(s), in which case you can add, delete, or edit the existing labels on your FiftyOne dataset.

The `label_schema` argument is the most flexible way to define how to construct tasks in CVAT. In its most verbose form, it is a dictionary that defines the label type, annotation type, possible classes, and possible attributes for each label field:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3label_schema = {
     4    "new_field": {
     5        "type": "classifications",
     6        "classes": ["class1", "class2"],
     7        "attributes": {
     8            "attr1": {
     9                "type": "select",
    10                "values": ["val1", "val2"],
    11                "default": "val1",
    12            },
    13            "attr2": {
    14                "type": "radio",
    15                "values": [True, False],
    16                "default": False,
    17            }
    18        },
    19    },
    20    "existing_field": {
    21        "classes": ["class3", "class4"],
    22        "attributes": {
    23            "attr3": {
    24                "type": "text",
    25            }
    26        }
    27    },
    28}
    29
    30dataset.annotate(anno_key, label_schema=label_schema)
    

You can also define class-specific attributes by setting elements of the `classes` list to dicts that specify groups of `classes` and their corresponding `attributes`. For example, in the configuration below, `attr1` only applies to `class1` and `class2` while `attr2` applies to all classes:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3label_schema = {
     4    "new_field": {
     5        "type": "detections",
     6        "classes": [
     7            {
     8                "classes": ["class1", "class2"],
     9                "attributes": {
    10                    "attr1": {
    11                        "type": "select",
    12                        "values": ["val1", "val2"],
    13                        "default": "val1",
    14                    }
    15                 }
    16            },
    17            "class3",
    18            "class4",
    19        ],
    20        "attributes": {
    21            "attr2": {
    22                "type": "radio",
    23                "values": [True, False],
    24                "default": False,
    25            }
    26        },
    27    },
    28}
    29
    30dataset.annotate(anno_key, label_schema=label_schema)
    

Alternatively, if you are only editing or creating a single label field, you can use the `label_field`, `label_type`, `classes`, `attributes`, and `mask_targets` parameters to specify the components of the label schema individually:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3label_field = "new_field",
     4label_type = "classifications"
     5classes = ["class1", "class2"]
     6
     7# These are optional
     8attributes = {
     9    "attr1": {
    10        "type": "select",
    11        "values": ["val1", "val2"],
    12        "default": "val1",
    13    },
    14    "attr2": {
    15        "type": "radio",
    16        "values": [True, False],
    17        "default": False,
    18    }
    19}
    20
    21dataset.annotate(
    22    anno_key,
    23    label_field=label_field,
    24    label_type=label_type,
    25    classes=classes,
    26    attributes=attributes,
    27)
    

When you are annotating existing label fields, you can omit some of these parameters from [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"), as FiftyOne can infer the appropriate values to use:

  * **label_type** : if omitted, the [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") type of the field will be used to infer the appropriate value for this parameter

  * **classes** : if omitted, the observed labels on your dataset will be used to construct a classes list

  * **mask_targets** : if omitted for a semantic segmentation field, the mask targets from the [`mask_targets`](../api/fiftyone.core.dataset.html#fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.mask_targets "fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.mask_targets") or [`default_mask_targets`](../api/fiftyone.core.dataset.html#fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.default_mask_targets "fiftyone.core.dataset.Dataset.default_mask_targets") properties of your dataset will be used, if available




### Label attributes#

The `attributes` parameter allows you to configure whether [custom attributes](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#using-labels) beyond the default `label` attribute are included in the annotation tasks.

When adding new label fields for which you want to include attributes, you must use the dictionary syntax demonstrated below to define the schema of each attribute that you wish to label:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3attributes = {
     4    "is_truncated": {
     5        "type": "radio",
     6        "values": [True, False],
     7        "default": False,
     8    },
     9    "gender": {
    10        "type": "select",
    11        "values": ["male", "female"],
    12    },
    13    "caption": {
    14        "type": "text",
    15    }
    16}
    17
    18view.annotate(
    19    anno_key,
    20    label_field="new_field",
    21    label_type="detections",
    22    classes=["dog", "cat", "person"],
    23    attributes=attributes,
    24)
    

You can always omit this parameter if you do not require attributes beyond the default `label`.

For CVAT, the following `type` values are supported:

  * `text`: a free-form text box. In this case, `default` is optional and `values` is unused

  * `select`: a selection dropdown. In this case, `values` is required and `default` is optional

  * `radio`: a radio button list UI. In this case, `values` is required and `default` is optional

  * `checkbox`: a boolean checkbox UI. In this case, `default` is optional and `values` is unused

  * `occluded`: CVATâs builtin occlusion toggle icon. This widget type can only be specified for at most one attribute, which must be a boolean

  * `group_id`: CVATâs grouping capabilities. This attribute type can only be specified for at most one attribute, which must be an integer




When you are annotating existing label fields, the `attributes` parameter can take additional values:

  * `True` (default): export all custom attributes observed on the existing labels, using their observed values to determine the appropriate UI type and possible values, if applicable

  * `False`: do not include any custom attributes in the export

  * a list of custom attributes to include in the export

  * a full dictionary syntax described above




Note that only scalar-valued label attributes are supported. Other attribute types like lists, dictionaries, and arrays will be omitted.

### Restricting additions, deletions, and edits#

When you create annotation runs that involve editing existing label fields, you can optionally specify that certain changes are not allowed by passing the following flags to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"):

  * **allow_additions** (_True_): whether to allow new labels to be added

  * **allow_deletions** (_True_): whether to allow labels to be deleted

  * **allow_label_edits** (_True_): whether to allow the `label` attribute to be modified

  * **allow_index_edits** (_True_): whether to allow the `index` attribute of video tracks to be modified

  * **allow_spatial_edits** (_True_): whether to allow edits to the spatial properties (bounding boxes, vertices, keypoints, etc) of labels




If you are using the `label_schema` parameter to provide a full annotation schema to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"), you can also directly include the above flags in the configuration dicts for any existing label field(s) you wish.

For example, suppose you have an existing `ground_truth` field that contains objects of various types and you would like to add new `sex` and `age` attributes to all people in this field while also strictly enforcing that no objects can be added, deleted, or have their labels or bounding boxes modified. You can configure an annotation run for this as follows:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3attributes = {
     4    "sex": {
     5        "type": "select",
     6        "values": ["male", "female"],
     7    },
     8    "age": {
     9        "type": "text",
    10    },
    11}
    12
    13view.annotate(
    14    anno_key,
    15    label_field="ground_truth",
    16    classes=["person"],
    17    attributes=attributes,
    18    allow_additions=False,
    19    allow_deletions=False,
    20    allow_label_edits=False,
    21    allow_spatial_edits=False,
    22)
    

You can also include a `read_only=True` parameter when uploading existing label attributes to specify that the attributeâs value should be uploaded to the annotation backend for informational purposes, but any edits to the attributeâs value should not be imported back into FiftyOne.

For example, if you have vehicles with their `make` attribute populated and you want to populate a new `model` attribute based on this information without allowing changes to the vehicleâs `make`, you can configure an annotation run for this as follows:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3attributes = {
     4    "make": {
     5        "type": "text",
     6        "read_only": True,
     7    },
     8    "model": {
     9        "type": "text",
    10    },
    11}
    12
    13view.annotate(
    14    anno_key,
    15    label_field="ground_truth",
    16    classes=["vehicle"],
    17    attributes=attributes,
    18)
    

Note that, if you use CVAT projects to organize your annotation tasks, the above restrictions must be manually re-specified in your call to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") for each annotation task that you add to an existing project, since CVAT does not provide support for these settings natively.

Warning

The CVAT backend does not support restrictions to additions, deletions, spatial edits, and read-only attributes in its editing interface.

However, any restrictions that you specify via the above parameters will still be enforced when you call [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") to merge the annotations back into FiftyOne.

**IMPORTANT** : When uploading existing labels to CVAT, the `id` of the labels in FiftyOne are stored in a `label_id` attribute of the CVAT shapes. If a `label_id` is modified in CVAT, then FiftyOne may not be able to merge the annotation with its existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instance; it must instead delete the existing label and create a new [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") with the shapeâs contents. In such cases, if `allow_additions` and/or `allow_deletions` were set to `False` on the annotation schema, this can result in CVAT edits being rejected. See this section for details.

### Labeling videos#

When annotating spatiotemporal objects in videos, you have a few additional options at your fingertips.

First, each object attribute specification can include a `mutable` property that controls whether the attributeâs value can change between frames for each object:
    
    
     1anno_key = "..."
     2
     3attributes = {
     4    "type": {
     5        "type": "select",
     6        "values": ["sedan", "suv", "truck"],
     7        "mutable": False,
     8    },
     9    "visible_license_plate": {
    10        "type": "radio",
    11        "values": [True, False],
    12        "default": False,
    13        "mutable": True,
    14    },
    15}
    16
    17view.annotate(
    18    anno_key,
    19    label_field="frames.new_field",
    20    label_type="detections",
    21    classes=["vehicle"],
    22    attributes=attributes,
    23)
    

The meaning of the `mutable` attribute is defined as follows:

  * `True` (default): the attribute is dynamic and can have a different value for every frame in which the object track appears

  * `False`: the attribute is static and is the same for every frame in which the object track appears




In addition, note that when you download annotation runs that include track annotations, the downloaded label corresponding to each keyframe of an object track will have its `keyframe=True` attribute set to denote that it was a keyframe.

Similarly, when you create an annotation run on a video dataset that involves editing existing video tracks, if at least one existing label has its `keyframe=True` attribute populated, then the available keyframe information will be uploaded to CVAT.

Note

See this section for video annotation examples!

Warning

When uploading existing labels to CVAT, the `id` of the labels in FiftyOne are stored in a `label_id` attribute of the CVAT shapes.

**IMPORTANT** : If a `label_id` is modified in CVAT, then FiftyOne may not be able to merge the annotation with its existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instance; in such cases, it must instead delete the existing label and create a new [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") with the shapeâs contents. See this section for details.

### CVAT limitations#

When uploading existing labels to CVAT, FiftyOne uses two sources of provenance to associate [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instances in FiftyOne with their corresponding CVAT shapes:

  * The `id` of each [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") is stored in a `label_id` attribute of the CVAT shape. When importing annotations from CVAT back into FiftyOne, if the `label_id` of a shape matches the ID of a label that was included in the annotation run, the shape will be merged into the existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label")

  * FiftyOne also maintains a mapping between [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") IDs and the internal CVAT shape IDs that are created when the CVAT tasks are created. If, during download, a CVAT shape whose `label_id` has been deleted or otherwise modified and doesnât match an existing label ID _but does have_ a recognized CVAT ID is encountered, this shape will be merged into the existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label")




Unfortunately, [CVAT does not guarantee](https://github.com/opencv/cvat/issues/893#issuecomment-578020576) that its internal IDs are immutable. Thus, if both the `label_id` attribute and (unknown to the user) the internal CVAT ID of a shape are both modified, merging the shape with its source [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") is impossible.

CVAT automatically clears/edits all attributes of a shape, including the `label_id` attribute, in the following cases:

  * When using a label schema with per-class attributes, all attributes of a shape are cleared whenever the class label of the shape is changed to a class whose attribute schema differs from the previous class. The recommended workaround in this case is to manually copy the `label_id` before changing the class and then pasting it back to ensure that the ID doesnât change.

  * When splitting or merging video tracks, CVAT may clear or duplicate the shapeâs attributes during the process. If this results in missing or duplicate `label_id` values, then, although FiftyOne will gracefully proceed with the import, provenance has still been lost and thus existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instances whose IDs no longer exist must be deleted and replaced with newly created [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instances.




The primary issues that can arise due to modified/deleted `label_id` attributes are:

  * If the original [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") in FiftyOne contained additional attributes that werenât included in the CVAT annotation run, then those attributes will be lost whenever loading annotations requires deleting the existing label and creating a new one.

  * When working with annotation schemas that specify edit restrictions, CVAT edits that cause `label_id` changes may need to be rejected. For example, if `allow_additions` and `allow_deletions` are set to `False` and editing a CVAT shapeâs class label causes its attributes to be cleared, then this change will be rejected by FiftyOne because it would require both deleting an existing label and creating a new one.




Note

**Pro tip** : If you are editing existing labels and only uploading a subset of their attributes to CVAT, restricting label deletions by setting `allow_deletions=False` provides a helpful guarantee that no labels will be deleted if label provenance snafus occur in CVAT.

Note

**Pro tip** : When working with annotation schemas that include per-class attributes, be sure that any class label changes that you would reasonably make all share the same attribute schemas so that unwanted `label_id` changes are not caused by CVAT.

If a schema-altering class change must occur, remember to manually copy the `label_id` before making the change and then paste it back to ensure that the ID doesnât change.

## Loading annotations#

After your annotations tasks in the annotation backend are complete, you can use the [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") method to download them and merge them back into your FiftyOne dataset.
    
    
    1view.load_annotations(anno_key)
    

The `anno_key` parameter is the unique identifier for the annotation run that you provided when calling [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"). You can use [`list_annotation_runs()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_annotation_runs "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_annotation_runs") to see the available keys on a dataset.

Note

By default, calling [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") will not delete any information for the run from the annotation backend.

However, you can pass `cleanup=True` to delete all information associated with the run from the backend after the annotations are downloaded.

You can use the optional `dest_field` parameter to override the taskâs label schema and instead load annotations into different field name(s) of your dataset. This can be useful, for example, when editing existing annotations, if you would like to do a before/after comparison of the edits that you import. If the annotation run involves multiple fields, `dest_field` should be a dictionary mapping label schema field names to destination field names.

Note that CVAT cannot explicitly prevent annotators from creating labels that donât obey the runâs label schema. However, you can pass the optional `unexpected` parameter to [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") to configure how to deal with any such unexpected labels that are found. The supported values are:

  * `"prompt"` (**default**): present an interactive prompt to direct/discard unexpected labels

  * `"ignore"`: automatically ignore any unexpected labels

  * `"keep"`: automatically keep all unexpected labels in a field whose name matches the label type

  * `"return"`: return a dict containing all unexpected labels, if any




See this section for more details.

## Managing annotation runs#

FiftyOne provides a variety of methods that you can use to manage in-progress or completed annotation runs.

For example, you can call [`list_annotation_runs()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_annotation_runs "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.list_annotation_runs") to see the available annotation keys on a dataset:
    
    
    1dataset.list_annotation_runs()
    

Or, you can use [`get_annotation_info()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_annotation_info "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_annotation_info") to retrieve information about the configuration of an annotation run:
    
    
    1info = dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key)
    2print(info)
    

Use [`load_annotation_results()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotation_results "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotation_results") to load the [`AnnotationResults`](../api/fiftyone.utils.annotations.html#fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults "fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults") instance for an annotation run.

All results objects provide a [`cleanup()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.annotations.html#fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults.cleanup "fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults.cleanup") method that you can use to delete all information associated with a run from the annotation backend.
    
    
    1results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    2results.cleanup()
    

In addition, the [`AnnotationResults`](../api/fiftyone.utils.annotations.html#fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults "fiftyone.utils.annotations.AnnotationResults") subclasses for each backend may provide additional utilities such as support for programmatically monitoring the status of the annotation tasks in the run.

You can use [`rename_annotation_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_annotation_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_annotation_run") to rename the annotation key associated with an existing annotation run:
    
    
    1dataset.rename_annotation_run(anno_key, new_anno_key)
    

Finally, you can use [`delete_annotation_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run") to delete the record of an annotation run from your FiftyOne dataset:
    
    
    1dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Note

Calling [`delete_annotation_run()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_annotation_run") only deletes the **record** of the annotation run from your FiftyOne dataset; it will not delete any annotations loaded onto your dataset via [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations"), nor will it delete any associated information from the annotation backend.

## Examples#

This section demonstrates how to perform some common annotation workflows on a FiftyOne dataset using the CVAT backend.

Note

All of the examples below assume you have configured your CVAT server and credentials as described in this section.

### Adding new label fields#

In order to annotate a new label field, you can provide the `label_field`, `label_type`, and `classes` parameters to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") to define the annotation schema for the field:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_new_field"
     8
     9view.annotate(
    10    anno_key,
    11    label_field="new_classifications",
    12    label_type="classifications",
    13    classes=["dog", "cat", "person"],
    14    launch_editor=True,
    15)
    16print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    17
    18# Create annotations in CVAT
    19
    20dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    21dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Alternatively, you can use the `label_schema` argument to define the same labeling task:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_new_field"
     8
     9label_schema = {
    10    "new_classifications": {
    11        "type": "classifications",
    12        "classes": ["dog", "cat", "person"],
    13    }
    14}
    15
    16view.annotate(anno_key, label_schema=label_schema, launch_editor=True)
    17print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    18
    19# Create annotations in CVAT
    20
    21dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    22dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Editing existing labels#

A common use case is to fix annotation mistakes that you discovered in your datasets through FiftyOne.

You can easily edit the labels in an existing field of your FiftyOne dataset by simply passing the name of the field via the `label_field` parameter of [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"):
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_existing_field"
     8
     9view.annotate(anno_key, label_field="ground_truth", launch_editor=True)
    10print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    11
    12# Modify/add/delete bounding boxes and their attributes in CVAT
    13
    14dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    15dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

  
The above code snippet will infer the possible classes and label attributes from your FiftyOne dataset. However, the `classes` and `attributes` parameters can be used to annotate new classes and/or attributes:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_existing_field"
     8
     9# The list of possible `label` values
    10classes = ["person", "dog", "cat", "helicopter"]
    11
    12# Details for the existing `iscrowd` attribute are automatically inferred
    13# A new `attr2` attribute is also added
    14attributes = {
    15    "iscrowd": {},
    16    "attr2": {
    17        "type": "select",
    18        "values": ["val1", "val2"],
    19    }
    20}
    21
    22view.annotate(
    23    anno_key,
    24    label_field="ground_truth",
    25    classes=classes,
    26    attributes=attributes,
    27    launch_editor=True,
    28)
    29print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    30
    31# Modify/add/delete bounding boxes and their attributes in CVAT
    32
    33dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    34dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Warning

When uploading existing labels to CVAT, the `id` of the labels in FiftyOne are stored in a `label_id` attribute of the CVAT shapes.

**IMPORTANT** : If a `label_id` is modified in CVAT, then FiftyOne may not be able to merge the annotation with its existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instance; in such cases, it must instead delete the existing label and create a new [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") with the shapeâs contents. See this section for details.

### Restricting label edits#

You can use the `allow_additions`, `allow_deletions`, `allow_label_edits`, `allow_index_edits`, and `allow_spatial_edits` parameters to configure whether certain types of edits are allowed in your annotation run. See this section for more information about the available options.

For example, suppose you have an existing `ground_truth` field that contains objects of various types and you would like to add new `sex` and `age` attributes to all people in this field while also strictly enforcing that no objects can be added, deleted, or have their labels or bounding boxes modified. You can configure an annotation run for this as follows:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3from fiftyone import ViewField as F
     4
     5dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     6
     7# Grab a sample that contains a person
     8view = (
     9    dataset
    10    .match_labels(filter=F("label") == "person", fields="ground_truth")
    11    .limit(1)
    12)
    13
    14anno_key = "cvat_edit_restrictions"
    15
    16# The new attributes that we want to populate
    17attributes = {
    18    "sex": {
    19        "type": "select",
    20        "values": ["male", "female"],
    21    },
    22    "age": {
    23        "type": "text",
    24    },
    25}
    26
    27view.annotate(
    28    anno_key,
    29    label_field="ground_truth",
    30    classes=["person"],
    31    attributes=attributes,
    32    allow_additions=False,
    33    allow_deletions=False,
    34    allow_label_edits=False,
    35    allow_spatial_edits=False,
    36    launch_editor=True,
    37)
    38print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    39
    40# Populate attributes in CVAT
    41
    42dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    43dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Similarly, you can include a `read_only=True` parameter when uploading existing label attributes to specify that the attributeâs value should be uploaded to the annotation backend for informational purposes, but any edits to the attributeâs value should not be imported back into FiftyOne.

For example, the snippet below uploads the vehicle tracks in a video dataset along with their existing `type` attributes and requests that a new `make` attribute be populated without allowing edits to the vehicleâs `type`:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-video")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_read_only_attrs"
     8
     9# Upload existing `type` attribute as read-only and add new `make` attribute
    10attributes = {
    11    "type": {
    12        "type": "text",
    13        "read_only": True,
    14    },
    15    "make": {
    16        "type": "text",
    17        "mutable": False,
    18    },
    19}
    20
    21view.annotate(
    22    anno_key,
    23    label_field="frames.detections",
    24    classes=["vehicle"],
    25    attributes=attributes,
    26    launch_editor=True,
    27)
    28print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    29
    30# Populate make attributes in CVAT
    31
    32dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    33dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Warning

The CVAT backend does not support restrictions to additions, deletions, spatial edits, and read-only attributes in its editing interface.

However, any restrictions that you specify via the above parameters will still be enforced when you call [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") to merge the annotations back into FiftyOne.

**IMPORTANT** : When uploading existing labels to CVAT, the `id` of the labels in FiftyOne are stored in a `label_id` attribute of the CVAT shapes. If a `label_id` is modified in CVAT, then FiftyOne may not be able to merge the annotation with its existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instance; it must instead delete the existing label and create a new [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") with the shapeâs contents. In such cases, if `allow_additions` and/or `allow_deletions` were set to `False` on the annotation schema, this can result in CVAT edits being rejected. See this section for details.

### Annotating multiple fields#

The `label_schema` argument allows you to define an annotation task that involves multiple fields:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_multiple_fields"
     8
     9# The details for existing `ground_truth` field are inferred
    10# A new field `new_keypoints` is also added
    11label_schema = {
    12    "ground_truth": {},
    13    "new_keypoints": {
    14        "type": "keypoints",
    15        "classes": ["person", "cat", "dog", "food"],
    16        "attributes": {
    17            "is_truncated": {
    18                "type": "select",
    19                "values": [True, False],
    20            }
    21        }
    22    }
    23}
    24
    25view.annotate(anno_key, label_schema=label_schema, launch_editor=True)
    26print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    27
    28# Add annotations in CVAT...
    29
    30dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    31dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Note

CVAT annotation schemas do not have a notion of label fields. Therefore, if you define an annotation schema that involves the same class label in multiple fields, the name of the label field will be appended to the class in CVAT in order to distinguish the class labels.

### Unexpected annotations#

The [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") method allows you to define the annotation schema that should be followed in CVAT. However, CVAT does not explicitly allow for restricting the label types that can be created, so it is possible that your annotators may accidentally violate a taskâs intended schema.

You can pass the optional `unexpected` parameter to [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") to configure how to deal with any such unexpected labels that are found. The supported values are:

  * `"prompt"` (**default**): present an interactive prompt to direct/discard unexpected labels

  * `"keep"`: automatically keep all unexpected labels in a field whose name matches the label type

  * `"ignore"`: automatically ignore any unexpected labels

  * `"return"`: return a dict containing all unexpected labels, if any




For example, suppose you upload a [`Detections`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Detections "fiftyone.core.labels.Detections") field to CVAT for editing, but then polyline annotations are added instead. When [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations") is called, the default behavior is to present a command prompt asking you what field(s) (if any) to store these unexpected labels in:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_unexpected"
     8
     9view.annotate(anno_key, label_field="ground_truth", launch_editor=True)
    10print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    11
    12# Add some polyline annotations in CVAT (wrong type!)
    13
    14# You will be prompted for a field in which to store the polylines
    15dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    16dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Creating projects#

You can use the optional `project_name` parameter to specify the name of a CVAT project to which to upload the task(s) for an annotation run. If a project with the given name already exists, the task will be uploaded to the existing project and will automatically inherit its annotation schema. Otherwise, a new project with the schema you define will be created.

A typical use case for this parameter is video annotation, since in CVAT every video must be annotated in a separate task. Creating a project allows all of the tasks to be organized together in one place.

As with tasks, you can delete the project associated with an annotation run by passing the `cleanup=True` option to [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations").
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-video")
     5view = dataset.take(3)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_create_project"
     8
     9view.annotate(
    10    anno_key,
    11    label_field="frames.detections",
    12    project_name="fiftyone_project_example",
    13    launch_editor=True,
    14)
    15print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    16
    17# Annotate videos in CVAT...
    18
    19dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    20dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Uploading to existing projects#

The `project_name` and `project_id` parameters can both be used to specify an existing CVAT project to which to upload the task(s) for an annotation run. In this case, the schema of the project is automatically applied to your annotation tasks.

A typical use case for this workflow is when you use the same annotation schema for multiple datasets, since this allows you to organize the tasks under one CVAT project and avoid the need to re-specify the label schema in FiftyOne.

Note

When uploading to existing projects, because the annotation schema is inherited from the CVAT project definition, any class/attribute specifications that you attempt to provide via arguments such as `label_schema`, `classes`, and `attributes` to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") will be ignored.

You can, however, use the `label_schema` and `label_field` arguments for the limited purpose of specifying the name of existing label field(s) to upload or the name and type of new field(s) in which you want to store the annotations that will be created. If no label fields are provided, then you will receive command line prompt(s) at import time to provide label field(s) in which to store the annotations.

Warning

Since the `label_schema` and `attribute` arguments are ignored, any occluded or group id attributes defined there will also be ignored. In order to connect occluded or group id attributes, use the `occluded_attr` and `group_id_attr` arguments directly.

### Assigning users#

When using the CVAT backend, you can provide the following optional parameters to [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") to specify which users will be assigned to the created tasks:

  * `segment_size`: the maximum number of images to include in a single job

  * `task_assignee`: a username to assign the generated tasks. This argument can be a list of usernames when annotating videos as each video is uploaded to a separate task

  * `job_assignees`: a list of usernames to assign jobs

  * `job_reviewers`: a list of usernames to assign job reviews. Only available in CVAT v1 servers




If the number of jobs exceeds the number of assignees or reviewers, the jobs will be assigned using a round-robin strategy.
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    20        "type": "keypoints",

    22    }

    37results.cleanup()
    38dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Large annotation runs#

The CVAT API imposes a limit on the size of all requests. By default, all images are uploaded to a single CVAT task, which can result in errors when uploading annotation runs for large sample collections.

Note

The CVAT maintainers made [an update](https://github.com/opencv/cvat/pull/3692) to resolve this issue natively, but if you still encounter issues, try the following workflow to circumvent the issue.

You can use the `task_size` parameter to break image annotation runs into multiple CVAT tasks, each with a specified maximum number of images. Note that we recommend providing a `project_name` whenever you use the `task_size` parameter so that the created tasks will be grouped together.

The `task_size` parameter can also be used in conjunction with the `segment_size` parameter to configure both the number of images per task as well as the number of images per job within each task.
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart", max_samples=20).clone()
     5
     6anno_key = "batch_upload"
     7
     8results = dataset.annotate(
     9    anno_key,
    10    label_field="ground_truth",
    11    task_size=6,  # 6 images per task
    12    segment_size=2,  # 2 images per job
    13    project_name="batch_example",
    14    launch_editor=True,
    15)
    16
    17# Annotate in CVAT...
    18
    19dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    

Note

The `task_size` parameter only applies to image datasets, since videos are always uploaded one per task.

### Scalar labels#

[`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") fields are the preferred way to store information for common tasks such as classification and detection in your FiftyOne datasets. However, you can also store CVAT annotations in scalar fields of type `float`, `int`, `str`, or `bool` .

When storing annotations in scalar fields, the `label_field` parameter is still used to define the name of the field, but the `classes` argument is now optional and the `attributes` argument is unused.

If `classes` are provided, you will be able to select from these values in CVAT; otherwise, the CVAT tag will show the `label_field` name and you must enter the appropriate scalar in the `value` attribute of the tag.

### Uploading alternate media#

In some cases, you may want to upload media files other than those stored in the `filepath` field of your datasetâs samples for annotation. For example, you may have a dataset with personal information like faces or license plates that must be anonymized before uploading for annotation.

The recommended approach in this case is to store the alternative media files for each sample on disk and record these paths in a new field of your FiftyOne dataset. You can then specify this field via the `media_field` parameter of [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate").

For example, letâs upload some blurred images to CVAT for annotation:
    
    
     1import os
     2import cv2
     3
     4import fiftyone as fo
     5import fiftyone.zoo as foz

    10alt_dir = "/tmp/blurred"
    11if not os.path.exists(alt_dir):
    12    os.makedirs(alt_dir)
    13
    14# Blur images
    15for sample in view:
    16    filepath = sample.filepath
    17    alt_filepath = os.path.join(alt_dir, os.path.basename(filepath))
    18
    19    img = cv2.imread(filepath)
    20    cv2.imwrite(alt_filepath, cv2.blur(img, (20, 20)))
    21
    22    sample["alt_filepath"] = alt_filepath
    23    sample.save()
    24
    25anno_key = "cvat_alt_media"
    26
    27view.annotate(
    28    anno_key,
    29    label_field="ground_truth",
    30    media_field="alt_filepath",
    31    launch_editor=True,
    32)
    33print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    34
    35# Create annotations in CVAT
    36
    37dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    38dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Using CVATâs occlusion widget#

The CVAT UI provides a variety of builtin widgets on each label you create that control properties like occluded, hidden, locked, and pinned.

You can configure CVAT annotation runs so that the state of the occlusion widget is read/written to a FiftyOne label attribute of your choice by specifying the attributeâs type as `occluded` in your label schema.

In addition, if you are editing existing labels using the `attributes=True` syntax (the default) to infer the label schema for an existing field, if a boolean attribute with the name `"occluded"` is found, it will automatically be linked to the occlusion widget.

Note

You can only specify the `occluded` type for at most one attribute of each label field/class in your label schema, and, if you are editing existing labels, the attribute that you choose must contain boolean values.
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart").clone()
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_occluded_widget"
     8
     9# Populate a new `occluded` attribute on the existing `ground_truth` labels
    10# using CVAT's occluded widget
    11label_schema = {
    12    "ground_truth": {
    13        "attributes": {
    14            "occluded": {
    15                "type": "occluded",
    16            }
    17        }
    18    }
    19}
    20
    21view.annotate(anno_key, label_schema=label_schema, launch_editor=True)

    25
    26dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    27dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

You can also use the `occluded_attr` parameter to sync the state of CVATâs occlusion widget with a specified attribute of all spatial fields that are being annotated that did not explicitly have an occluded attribute defined in the label schema.

This parameter is especially useful when working with existing CVAT projects, since CVAT project schemas are not able to retain information about occluded attributes between annotation runs.

    26dataset.load_annotations(anno_key, cleanup=True)
    27dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Using CVAT groups#

The CVAT UI provides a way to group objects together both visually and through a group id in the API.

You can configure CVAT annotation runs so that the state of the group id is read/written to a FiftyOne label attribute of your choice by specifying the attributeâs type as `group_id` in your label schema.

In addition, if you are editing existing labels using the `attributes=True` syntax (the default) to infer the label schema for an existing field, if a boolean attribute with the name `"group_id"` is found, it will automatically be linked to CVAT groups.

Note

You can only specify the `group_id` type for at most one attribute of each label field/class in your label schema, and, if you are editing existing labels, the attribute that you choose must contain integer values.
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo

    13            "group_id": {
    14                "type": "group_id",
    15            }

    27dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Changing destination field#

When annotating an existing label field, it can be useful to load the annotations into a different field than the one used to upload annotations. The `dest_field` parameter can be used for this purpose when calling [`load_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_annotations").

If your annotation run involves a single label field, set `dest_field` to the name of the (new or existing) field you wish to load annotations into.

If your annotation run involves multiple fields, `dest_field` should be a dictionary mapping existing field names in your runâs label schema to updated destination fields.
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart").clone()
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "dest_field"
     8label_field = "ground_truth"
     9
    10# Upload from `ground_truth` field
    11view.annotate(
    12    anno_key,
    13    label_field=label_field,
    14)
    15print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    16
    17# Load into `test_field`
    18dest_field = "test_field"
    19
    20# If your run involves multiple fields, use this syntax instead
    21# dest_field = {"ground_truth": "test_field", ...}
    22
    23dataset.load_annotations(
    24    anno_key,
    25    cleanup=True,
    26    dest_field=dest_field,
    27)
    28dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Using frame start, stop, step#

When annotating videos, you can use the arguments `frame_start`, `frame_stop`, and `frame_step` to annotate subsampled clips of your videos rather than loading every frame into CVAT. These arguments are only supported for video tasks and accept either integer values to use for each video task that is created, a list of values that will be applied to video tasks in a round-robin strategy, or a dictionary of values mapping the video filepath to the corresponding integer value.

Note: Uploading existing annotation tracks while using the `frame_step` argument is not currently supported.
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-video", max_samples=2).clone()
     5sample_fps = dataset.values("filepath")
     6
     7# Start video 1 at frame 10 and video 2 at frame 5
     8frame_start = {sample_fps[0]: 10, sample_fps[1]: 5}
     9
    10# For video 1, load every frame after the start
    11# For video 2, load every 10th frame
    12frame_step = [1, 10]
    13
    14# Stop all videos at frame 100
    15frame_stop = 100
    16
    17anno_key = "frame_args"
    18label_field = "frames.new_detections"
    19label_type = "detections"
    20classes = ["person", "vehicle"]
    21
    22# Annotate a new detections field
    23dataset.annotate(
    24    anno_key,
    25    label_field=label_field,
    26    label_type=label_type,
    27    classes=classes,
    28    frame_start=frame_start,
    29    frame_stop=frame_stop,
    30    frame_step=frame_step,
    31)
    32print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    33
    34# Annotate in CVAT
    35
    36dataset.load_annotations(
    37    anno_key,
    38    cleanup=True,
    39)
    40dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

## Annotating videos#

You can add or edit annotations for video datasets using the CVAT backend through the [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") method.

All CVAT label types except `tags` provide an option to annotate **tracks** in videos, which captures the identity of a single object as it moves through the video. When you import video tracks into FiftyOne, the `index` attribute of each label will contain the integer number of its track, and any labels that are keyframes will have their `keyframe=True` attribute set.

Note that CVAT does not provide a straightforward way to annotate sample-level classification labels for videos. Instead, we recommend that you use frame-level fields to record classifications for your video datasets.

Note

CVAT only allows one video per task, so calling [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") on a video dataset will result multiple tasks per label field.

### Adding new frame labels#

The example below demonstrates how to configure a video annotation task that populates a new frame-level field of a video dataset with vehicle detection tracks with an immutable `type` attribute that denotes the type of each vehicle:

Note

Prepend `"frames."` to reference frame-level fields when calling [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate").

    16    classes=["vehicle"],
    17    attributes={
    18        "type": {
    19            "type": "select",
    20            "values": ["sedan", "suv", "truck", "other"],
    21            "mutable": False,
    22        }

    37results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    38results.cleanup()
    39dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

### Editing frame-level label tracks#

You can also edit existing frame-level labels of video datasets in CVAT.

Note

If at least one existing label has its `keyframe=True` attribute set, only the keyframe labels will be uploaded to CVAT, which provides a better editing experience when performing spatial or time-varying attribute edits.

If no keyframe information is available, every existing label must be marked as a keyframe in CVAT.

The example below edits the existing detections of a video dataset. Note that, since the datasetâs labels do not have keyframe markings, we artificially tag every 10th frame as a keyframe to provide a better editing experience in CVAT:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart-video").clone()
     5
     6view = dataset.take(1)
     7
     8# Mark some keyframes
     9sample = view.first()
    10num_frames = len(sample.frames)
    11keyframes = set(range(1, num_frames, 10)).union({1, num_frames})
    12for frame_number in keyframes:
    13    frame = sample.frames[frame_number]
    14    for det in frame.detections.detections:
    15        det.keyframe = True
    16
    17sample.save()
    18
    19anno_key = "cvat_video"
    20
    21# Send frame-level detections to CVAT
    22view.annotate(
    23    anno_key,
    24    label_field="frames.detections",
    25    launch_editor=True,
    26)
    27print(dataset.get_annotation_info(anno_key))
    28
    29# Edit annotations in CVAT...
    30
    31# Merge edits back in
    32dataset.load_annotations(anno_key)
    33
    34# Load the view that was annotated in the App
    35view = dataset.load_annotation_view(anno_key)
    36session = fo.launch_app(view=view)
    37
    38# Cleanup
    39results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    40results.cleanup()
    41dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    

Warning

When uploading existing labels to CVAT, the `id` of the labels in FiftyOne are stored in a `label_id` attribute of the CVAT shapes.

**IMPORTANT** : If a `label_id` is modified in CVAT, then FiftyOne may not be able to merge the annotation with its existing [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") instance; in such cases, it must instead delete the existing label and create a new [`Label`](../api/fiftyone.core.labels.html#fiftyone.core.labels.Label "fiftyone.core.labels.Label") with the shapeâs contents. See this section for details.

## Annotating 3D data#

CVAT supports annotating 3D detections on point cloud data.

In order to perform 3D annotation with CVAT on [3D datasets](../user_guide/using_datasets.html#d-datasets) in FiftyOne, you must populate a field on your FiftyOne dataset for each sample that you wish to annotate that contains the path to the 3D asset(s) to upload in one of [CVATâs supported formats](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/manual/basics/create_an_annotation_task/#data-formats-for-a-3d-task), which includes:

  * the path to the `.pcd` file to upload

  * the path to a structured zip archive including the PCD file and optional reference images




Then simply provide this field name via the `media_field` argument when you call [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate"):

    11# structured zip archive including reference images along with the PCD
    12#
    13pcd_filepaths = [f.replace(".fo3d", ".pcd") for f in view.values("filepath")]
    14view.set_values("pcd_filepath", pcd_filepaths)

    28session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
    

## Importing existing tasks#

FiftyOneâs CVAT integration is designed to manage the full annotation workflow, from task creation to annotation import.

However, if you have created CVAT tasks outside of FiftyOne, you can use the [`import_annotations()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.import_annotations "fiftyone.utils.cvat.import_annotations") utility to import individual task(s) or an entire project into a FiftyOne dataset.

    52session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
    

Note

Another strategy for importing existing CVAT annotations into FiftyOne is to simply export the annotations from the CVAT UI and then import them via the [CVATImageDataset](../user_guide/import_datasets.html#cvatimagedataset-import) or [CVATVideoDataset](../user_guide/import_datasets.html#cvatvideodataset-import) types.

## Additional utilities#

You can perform additional CVAT-specific operations to monitor the progress of an annotation task initiated by [`annotate()`](../api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate "fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.annotate") via the returned [`CVATAnnotationResults`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults") instance.

The sections below highlight some common actions that you may want to perform.

### Using the CVAT API#

You can use the [`connect_to_api()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.annotations.html#fiftyone.utils.annotations.connect_to_api "fiftyone.utils.annotations.connect_to_api") to retrieve a [`CVATAnnotationAPI`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationAPI "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationAPI") instance, which is a wrapper around the [CVAT REST API](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/rest_api_guide/) that provides convenient methods for performing common actions on your CVAT tasks:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3import fiftyone.utils.annotations as foua
     4
     5dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     6view = dataset.take(1)
     7
     8anno_key = "cvat_api"
     9
    10view.annotate(anno_key, label_field="ground_truth")
    11
    12api = foua.connect_to_api()
    13
    14# The context manager is optional and simply ensures that TCP connections
    15# are always closed
    16with api:
    17    # Launch CVAT in your browser
    18    api.launch_editor(api.base_url)
    19
    20    # Get info about all tasks currently on the CVAT server
    21    response = api.get(api.tasks_url).json()
    

### Viewing task statuses#

You can use the [`get_status()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults.get_status "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults.get_status") and [`print_status()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults.print_status "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults.print_status") methods to get information about the current status of the task(s) and job(s) for that annotation run:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(3)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_status"
     8
     9view.annotate(
    10    anno_key,
    11    label_field="ground_truth",
    12    segment_size=2,
    13    task_assignee="user1",
    14    job_assignees=["user1"],
    15    job_reviewers=["user2", "user3"],
    16)
    17
    18results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    19results.print_status()
    20
    21results.cleanup()
    22dataset.delete_annotation_run(anno_key)
    
    
    
    Status for label field 'ground_truth':
    
        Task 331 (FiftyOne_quickstart_ground_truth):
            Status: annotation
            Assignee: user1
            Last updated: 2021-08-11T15:09:02.680181Z
            URL: http://localhost:8080/tasks/331
    
            Job 369:
                Status: annotation
                Assignee: user1
                Reviewer: user2
    
            Job 370:
                Status: annotation
                Assignee: user1
                Reviewer: user3
    

Note

**Pro tip** : If you are iterating over many annotation runs, you can use [`connect_to_api()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.annotations.html#fiftyone.utils.annotations.connect_to_api "fiftyone.utils.annotations.connect_to_api") and [`use_api()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults.use_api "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationResults.use_api") as shown below to reuse a single [`CVATAnnotationAPI`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationAPI "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationAPI") instance and avoid reauthenticating with CVAT for each run:
    
    
    1import fiftyone.utils.annotations as foua
    2
    3api = foua.connect_to_api()
    4
    5for anno_key in dataset.list_annotation_runs():
    6    results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    7    results.use_api(api)
    8    results.print_status()
    

### Deleting tasks#

You can use the [`delete_task()`](../api/fiftyone.utils.cvat.html#fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationAPI.delete_task "fiftyone.utils.cvat.CVATAnnotationAPI.delete_task") method to delete specific CVAT tasks associated with an annotation run:
    
    
     1import fiftyone as fo
     2import fiftyone.zoo as foz
     3
     4dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
     5view = dataset.take(1)
     6
     7anno_key = "cvat_delete_tasks"
     8
     9view.annotate(anno_key, label_field="ground_truth")
    10
    11results = dataset.load_annotation_results(anno_key)
    12api = results.connect_to_api()
    13
    14print(results.task_ids)
    15# [372]
    16
    17api.delete_task(372)
